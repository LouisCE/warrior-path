# Warrior Path

Warrior Path is a fictional martial arts gym website developed as part of a front-end development project for Code Institute in 2025. This project demonstrates skills in responsive design, accessibility, and front-end best practices using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Purpose

This project simulates the development of a professional front-end website for a martial arts gym, intended to showcase a clean, accessible, and responsive design. The goal is to create a clean, accessible and responsive website that aims to provide visitors with clear and easy access to essential information such as class offerings, trainer profiles, educational content on mixed martial arts (MMA) and membership sign-ups. This project also emphasises practical application of UX principles while showcasing semantic HTML, and CSS best practices.


## Value to Users

The website helps users understand what the school offers, who the instructors are, and how to sign up. It also gives them an impression of the school's tone and style. Clear navigation and responsive design make it easy to use on any device. Users can quickly find detailed class information, learn about the expertise of trainers, and easily join the gym through an intuitive sign-up form. The website's responsive design ensures seamless usability across devices, while accessibility makes it inclusive for users with visual impairments.


## Key Features

- **Responsive Layout:** Utilizes Bootstrap 5â€™s grid system and media queries to ensure the site adapts elegantly to all screen sizes.
- **Navigation:** Fully functional, sticky navigation bar with clear active states provides easy and consistent site navigation.
- **Consistent Styling:** Harmonised color palette and typography maintain a professional and approachable brand image. A dark theme was chosen for the background to create a sleek, professional appearance. Red was considered too aggressive for a martial arts website, so orange was chosen instead to add vibrancy and pop against the dark background.
- **Custom Forms:** Accessible and user-friendly sign-up form with validation prompts to facilitate membership registration.
- **Standards Compliant:** HTML and CSS validated with zero errors, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and clean code.
- **Accessibility:** Designed with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes to support users with disabilities.

## Accessibility

This website supports keyboard navigation to enhance accessibility. Interactive elements such as navigation links and call-to-action (CTA) buttons have visible `:focus` styles, allowing users who navigate using the Tab key to clearly see which element is currently selected. The focus styles use a high-contrast orange (#ffa040) consistent with the hover styles for visual continuity. Additionally, form inputs and buttons highlight on focus to assist users relying on keyboard interaction.

### Accessibility Testing

**Keyboard Navigation Test:**  
Pressing the Tab key cycles through all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields). Each focused element is clearly highlighted with a bright orange outline or underline. No elements are skipped, and focus order is logical.
**Result:** Pass

## How to Run/Preview the Project

You can preview the website locally by opening the HTML files directly in your web browser. No additional setup is required.
