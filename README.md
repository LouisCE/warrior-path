# Warrior Path Martial Arts

This is a responsive martial arts gym website that adapts without issue to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens, which is proven in the image below. Its purpose is to promote an inclusive mixed martial arts school and get users to sign up for classes.

This image shows how the Warrior Path Martial Arts website displays seamlessly across a range of devices, including desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile. The design uses a mobile-first approach with Bootstrap 5.3.7, ensuring all content is readable, cleanly laid out, and user-friendly no matter the screen size. Every section is stacked and spaced nicely to deliver an excellent user experience.

Warrior Path Martial Arts is a fictional martial arts gym website developed as part of a front-end development project for Code Institute in 2025. This project uses responsive design, high accessibility and front-end best practices using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little bit of JavaScript.

It provides valuable information about classes, teachers and opportunities to sign up for both adults and juniors. With a clean layout, smooth scroll-friendly Instagram-like navigation, and carefully chosen visuals, the site delivers an engaging experience across all devices.

Whether the user is a curious beginner, a parent looking for the right class for their child, or an experienced martial artist looking for a place where they can test their limits, Warrior Path has a lot to offer.

## Purpose

This project simulates the development of a professional front-end website for a martial arts gym, intended to showcase a clean, accessible, and responsive design. The goal is to create a clean, accessible and responsive website that aims to provide visitors with clear and easy access to essential information such as class offerings, trainer profiles, educational content on mixed martial arts (MMA) and membership sign-ups. This project also emphasises practical application of UX principles while showcasing semantic HTML, and CSS best practices.

## Key Features

I designed Warrior Path with both first-time visitors and returning students in mind. It combines accessibility, responsiveness, and clarity with a bold, energetic aesthetic.

### Design & Layout
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** This was built with Bootstrap 5’s grid system and media queries for seamless viewing across different sized devices.
- **Dark Theme with Vibrant Accents:** The sleek dark background contrasts with orange highlights, which I chose over red to create a warm and welcoming tone without being intimidating to new users.
- **Clean Visual Hierarchy:** Consistent use of typography and colour for clarity and readability across all sections.

### Navigation & Structure
- **Sticky Navbar:** Persistent, clearly labeled navigation bar with active state indicators and smooth scrolling.
- **Logical Section Flow:** Content is laid out in a logical order and all of one page for a simple, vertical scrolling experience.

### Content & Interactivity
- **Informative Sections:** Clearly labeled content blocks for coaches, classes, pricing, opening hours, and testimonials.
- **Call-to-Actions:** Prominent "Sign Up Today" buttons appear early and near the footer to encourage engagement.
- **Embedded Form:** Accessible, user-friendly sign-up and enquiry form with validation for smooth submissions.

### Accessibility & Standards
- **Keyboard Navigation & Focus States:** All interactive elements are accessible with visible focus indicators.
- **ARIA & Alt Attributes:** Enhances usability for screen readers and assistive technology users.
- **Validated Code:** HTML and CSS files pass W3C validation with zero errors, ensuring reliability and compatibility.

The final layout offers a focused, distraction-free experience that encourages users to explore, build trust, and take action confidently.

## Value to Users

The website helps users understand what the school offers, who the instructors are, and how to sign up. It also gives them an impression of the school's tone and style. Clear navigation and responsive design make it easy to use on any device. Users can quickly find detailed class information, learn about the expertise of trainers, and easily join the gym through an intuitive sign-up form. The website's responsive design ensures seamless usability across devices, while accessibility makes it inclusive for users with visual impairments.

## Website Goals and Objectives

- Clearly communicate the types of martial arts offered (striking and grappling styles).

- Highlight the professionalism of the coaching team and training environment.
- Make joining easy with a clean, accessible sign-up form and call-to-action sections.

## Target Audience

The main audience includes:

- Adults seeking self-improvement through martial arts.
- Parents looking for safe, structured activities for children.
- Teens interested in competitive or recreational combat sports.
- Fitness-focused individuals looking for striking or grappling-based alternatives to gyms.
- Returning martial artists seeking a new place to train.
- Experienced martial artists seeking new instructors or facilities

The design and layout reflect balances accessibility and approachability which caters to all of these groups.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq, following a mobile-first approach in line with best practices. I started by sketching layouts for mobile screens and then expanded them for tablet and desktop to make sure the structure worked at all breakpoints.

The final live site follows the overall structure of the wireframes but a few adjustments were made during development to improve flow, responsiveness, and accessibility:

- The info section was simplified into a vertical scroll layout for mobile readability.
- Class types were clearly split into Junior and Adult categories to help users find what they need.
- Images were updated to better reflect striking and grappling martial arts.
- Some sections were reordered slightly to improve reading experience on mobile.
- Bootstrap’s grid system was used to restructure a few blocks for better responsiveness.

The final site remains a single scrollable page, designed to reduce navigation friction and support smooth exploration across all devices.

**Wireframe links:**

![Tablet Wireframes](docs/wireframes-tablet.png)
![Desktop Wireframes](docs/wireframes-computer.png)

## UX Design Approach

I created this project while following key UX design principles, such as:

- **User Research:** I considered the expectations of gym members, parents, and martial artists. Common goals include finding schedules, reading about instructors, looking at prices.
- **Wireframing:** I sketched rough layouts to visualise navigation flow and content hierarchy.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Used font sizes, spacing, and colour contrast to guide user attention. Primary CTAs are positioned prominently.
- **Accessibility First:** ARIA labels, alt text, tab order, and contrast were used from the outset, not added after. (will add more ARIA later)
- **Feedback Loops:** Peer review and user feedback from mentors and alumni helped identify areas to improve clarity and layout.

## Design Choices

- **Orange highlights**: Used for focus and hover states to guide user interaction.
- **Responsive design**: Ensures usability on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Chosen for its ease of use and mobile-first approach.
- **Image consistency**: All images follow a clean and modern visual style.
- **Alt attributes**: Support screen readers and visually impaired users.

### Typography

The primary font families chosen for Warrior Path Martial Arts are [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter "Inter") and [Macondo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Macondo "Macondo").  
- **Inter** is a modern, highly legible sans-serif typeface that ensures clarity for all body text across devices.  
- **Macondo** is a decorative, handwritten-style font used for headings to reflect the spirited, traditional identity of martial arts.
This combination creates a balance between readability and stylistic flair that aligns with the ethos of Warrior Path, discipline and fun.

### Colour Scheme

The Warrior Path website uses a bold, bright orange colour palette to reflect energy, confidence, and focus:
- **Primary Accent:** `#ff6600` – a vibrant orange, symbolising strength, action, and urgency.
- **Hover Accent:** `#ffa040` – a softer orange tone used for hover states and calls to action.
- **Base Theme:** `#1a1a1a` dark grey/black background to enhance contrast and create a striking visual hierarchy.
- **Text Colour:** White and light greys for high legibility against the dark theme.

All colours were chosen with accessibility and visual impact in mind. The palette is consistent with martial arts branding and helps create a sense of professionalism and energy. The dark background provides a sleek, professional appearance while the bright orange pops against the black for high visibility. Red was considered in place of orange but I thought it would be too aggressive and intimidating for a martial arts website.

![Warrior Path Colour Scheme](docs/colour-scheme.png)

Contrast grid was also used so that I could get more ideas for shades of colours that would fit my website's theme.

![Warrior Path Colour Scheme](docs/screenshot-colour-grid.png)

### Images

The site uses a curated collection of imagery designed to reflect the spirit of martial arts. Images were chosen from Google Images to represent:

- **Juniors and Seniors** training in a focused, welcoming environment.
- **Striking arts** like Muay Thai and Boxing, with photos showing form.
- **Grappling arts** like Wrestling and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, displaying positional technique and control.

I combined Bootstrap’s responsive classes with custom CSS to ensure that visuals scale naturally across devices without causing layout issues or horizontal scrolling.

Images complement the tone of each section and nicely portray the training styles available.

### Responsiveness

The website was built mobile-first, ensuring usability across a wide range of devices. I used Bootstrap 5’s responsive grid system in combination with custom CSS media queries to handle layout adjustments. The navigation bar becomes a collapsible menu on small screens, and content sections stack vertically to prioritise readability.

Testing across device emulators and real devices helped ensure layouts didn't break at key breakpoints (576px, 768px, 992px, 1200px). Particular care was taken to ensure:

- Text remains legible without zooming.
- Tap targets are large and well-spaced.
- Visual hierarchy remains clear across screen sizes.

Each section, from the hero header to the info columns and call-to-action, adapts layout and spacing across devices to maintain readability and flow. Flexbox and utility classes helped ensure clean stacking on mobile while preserving side-by-side content on larger screens.

## Features

The website layout is clean, focused, and built for clarity. Visitors can scroll through all content in a single-page layout, mimicking a modern one-page structure like Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn. Section transitions are smooth, content is clearly separated, and visual hierarchy ensures no part overwhelms the user.

### Existing Features

- Home (`index.html`)
- Classes (`classes.html`)
- Trainers (`trainers.html`)
- Join Us (`signup.html`)

#### Header

The site features a simplified custom navbar that maintains consistency across screen sizes. It includes a Macondo font for a tough, yet elegant aesthetic and a menu with multiple options (i.e. Home, Classes, Trainers, Join Us).

- **On mobile:** the menu condenses for vertical space efficiency.
- **On desktop:** full links are displayed inline for ease of access.
- The minimalist styling and contrast ensure high visibility and accessibility.

![Header Screenshot](docs/screenshot-header.png)

#### Hero Section
The homepage opens with a bold hero banner that immediately communicates the purpose of the site, to inspire and motivate users to begin their martial arts journey.

- Eye-catching banner introduces the brand
- Clear navigation to other pages
- Welcoming call to action

The hero banner displays a large, full-width image accompanied by a bold heading ("Unlock Your Potential") and a primary call-to-action button ("Sign Up Today").

- Image scales cleanly across devices.
- Typography is centered and resized based on screen width.

This section creates immediate visual impact and sets the tone for the rest of the page.

![Hero section screenshot](docs/screenshot-home.png)

#### Landing View

The site follows a single-page application layout to maintain fast performance, a smooth Instagram-like scroll experience, and intuitive structure. The landing section includes:

- **Hero headline** encouraging users to start their journey.
- **Sign Up Today** button with hover animation.
- **Branding** that introduces the ethos of Warrior Path Martial Arts.

All interactions are optimised for mobile. Buttons are styled consistently across the page with high-contrast orange and accessible sizing. Layout adapts naturally for smaller screens.

#### About Section
Provides a warm, community-focused introduction to the gym’s mission, values, and atmosphere. Perfect for new visitors trying to understand the vibe.

![About section screenshot](docs/screenshot-about.png)

#### Info Columns

Below the hero, three main content columns communicate:

- **Timetable and Opening Hours**
- **Testimonials from Students and Parents**
- **Pricing Structure**

These are stacked on mobile for ease of reading and display in columns on larger screens. Icons and images enhance visual separation and aid scannability.

#### Pricing & Testimonials
These blocks use card layouts for easy scanning. Testimonials help build trust, while pricing is clear and friendly. Cards are fully responsive and stack beautifully on mobile.

![Pricing and testimonials screenshot](docs/screenshot-info.png)

#### Class Overview

Class sections are divided by age group and discipline, making it easier for users to identify what training options work best for them:

- **Juniors:** safe, structured programs for kids.
- **Adults:** more intensive classes for adults.

This separation helps potential students or parents quickly find relevant info.

Each section is accompanied by visuals of what the age groups look like and concise descriptions to help new visitors understand the benefits of different martial arts.

![Classes Page Screenshot](docs/screenshot-classes.png)

#### Mixed Martial Arts Breakdown

This part breaks down martial arts disciplines into striking and grappling, clearly explaining the four disciplines that Warrior Path teaches without being overwhelming. 

Among the striking arts are:

- **Boxing**: Focus on punching, head movement and footwork.
- **Muay Thai**: Focus on punching is less pure but it mixes in kicks, elbows and knees.

Among the grappling arts are:

- **Wrestling**: Focus on takedowns and positional control.
- **Brazilian Jiu Jitsu**: Focus on chokes and submissions.

The alternating grid layout with images is visually appealing and helps keep the page dynamic and readable.

![Classes section screenshot](docs/screenshot-classes-2.png)

#### Coach Profiles

Instructor bios are accompanied by photographs in circular format, names and short role descriptions. All sections are vertically stacked on small screens and aligned in columns on desktops. This section includes:

- Profile cards for each instructor
- Pictures of each instructor.
- Names of each instructor.
- Bio and specialties of each instructor

This builds credibility and trust with site visitors, especially parents considering classes for children.

![Trainers Page Screenshot](docs/screenshot-trainers.png)

#### Signup Form

The sign-up form serves as the call-to-action section of the page. It includes required fields:

- Full name  
- Email address  
- What are you hoping to achieve? 
- Designed for easy user interaction

 It includes a working contact form to book a free first lesson. Fields are clearly labeled and spaced. All fields are required. A thank you message confirms submission.

#### Footer

The footer is designed with simplicity and elegance to align with the site’s clean, minimal aesthetic.

- Contains links to the studio’s **social media**. 
- **Icons are spaced** for touch accessibility.
- Styled with **hover effects** in keeping with the rest of the UI.

### Other Pages

#### Submission Confirmation Page

I added a confirmation page to make it clear to the user that their form has been submitted.

![Success Page](docs/success.png)

#### 404 Page

I added a fun and onbrand custom 404 error page to handle broken or mistyped URLs so that the user has a positive experience, even when visiting a nonexistent page.

- Displays a **clear error message**.
- Includes a **5-second redirect** to the homepage.
- Also features a **home icon** for immediate manual return.

I manually tested every feature of the Warrior Path website using Chrome and DevTools. This includes buttons, forms, navigation links, interactive JavaScript features and mobile responsiveness.

All core features were tested against expected behaviors, including:

- Navigation links scroll smoothly to the correct section.
- The mobile navbar toggles open and closed as expected.
- The contact/signup form correctly redirects to a confirmation page.
- The layout remains consistent and readable at all major breakpoints.
- Image scaling, padding and section spacing all respond properly on different devices.
- Keyboard focus outlines are visible on interactive elements for accessibility.

Testing was done throughout development and final checks were made once the content and layout were complete.

## Accessibility Testing

Accessibility was a key priority in the design and development of Warrior Path Martial Arts. I implemented the following measures to support inclusive use:

- **Responsive layout** using Bootstrap 5.3.7 ensures readability across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktops.
- **Semantic HTML5 tags** such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are used to help screen readers and assistive technology interpret the content structure correctly.
- **ARIA labels** have been included where necessary (for example, with form inputs) to provide extra context and improve form accessibility for screen readers.
- **High-contrast colours** between text and background elements aid readability.
- **Alt text** has been added for all images, making visual content accessible to visually impaired users.
- **Keyboard navigability** is preserved through standard HTML elements and logical layout.
- **Form validation** and `required` attributes ensure users receive feedback when submitting forms incorrectly.

These practices ensure the site is inclusive, usable, and compliant with basic WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.

This website supports keyboard navigation to enhance accessibility. Interactive elements such as navigation links and call-to-action (CTA) buttons have visible `:focus` styles, allowing users who navigate using the Tab key to clearly see which element is currently selected. The focus styles use a high-contrast orange (#ffa040) consistent with the hover styles for visual continuity. Additionally, form inputs and buttons highlight on focus to assist users relying on keyboard interaction.

**Keyboard Navigation Test:**  
Pressing the Tab key cycles through all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields). Each focused element is clearly highlighted with a bright orange outline or underline. No elements are skipped, and focus order is logical.
**Result:** Pass

I used the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to assess the accessibility of the deployed site.

### Summary of Results

| Type                  | Count                | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Errors**            | 3 Contrast Errors     | Mostly to do with muted footer text or blockquote footers.            |
| **Alerts**            | 3 Alerts              | All reviewed and either resolved or justified below.                  |
| **Features**          | 15 Features           | Good use of alternative text and ARIA labels throughout.              |
| **Structural Elements** | 27                | Proper heading levels and semantic structure used throughout.         |
| **ARIA**              | 11                    | Includes proper use of `aria-label` and other helpful roles.          |

### Contrast Errors

WAVE flagged three contrast issues. These were related to muted grey text on dark backgrounds, particularly in the `.blockquote-footer` class under Testimonials. I attempted to fix this using lighter grey tones (`#ccc`, `#ddd`) and custom overrides, but Bootstrap sometimes overpowered the styling. Since the text remains clearly legible and passed visual inspection, I decided to retain the current look. I’ve acknowledged the contrast warnings here and can revisit this post-deadline if needed.

### Alerts

There were 3 WAVE alerts, two of which were due to “Suspicious alternative text”. It seems that WAVE tends to flag alt descriptions that it considers to not be sufficiently descriptive.

I resolved these by rewriting the `alt` text for all relevant images to be more specific and contextual. For example:

**html**
alt="Inside the Warrior Path gym to welcome the user into the environment"
alt="Image of the gym's interior to show off the equipment and amount of space"
alt="Students posing together to show off the gym's friendly environment"
alt="Image of a famous quote from Muhammad Ali to motivate students and users"

### Lighthouse Testing

I tested the website using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome’s Incognito Mode to eliminate extension interference.

| Category        | Score |
|----------------|-------|
| Performance     | 93    |
| Accessibility   | 95    |
| Best Practices  | 100   |
| SEO             | 91    |

All categories recieved a score above 90, which can be seen below. Performance improved significantly after running in Incognito mode, with images optimised and layout tested across devices. Accessibility adjustments included ARIA labels, valid `alt` text, contrast improvements, and structural heading order.

### Conclusion

All critical accessibility issues were addressed. Minor alerts and contrast warnings are documented and do not hinder usability. The final Lighthouse audit confirmed a strong Accessibility score of 95/100, and the WAVE tool shows no major issues remaining.

## Browser Testing

I tested the website using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to evaluate its performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO compliance on desktop.

**PageSpeed Insights (Desktop):**

| Category        | Score |
|----------------|-------|
| Performance     | 94    |
| Accessibility   | 95    |
| Best Practices  | 100   |
| SEO             | 91    |

These scores confirm that the site is fast, accessible, standards-compliant, and search-engine friendly on modern desktop browsers.

## Last Minute Fixes

Given that I had a bit of extra time, I revisited WAVE and managed to cut the number of alerts from 3 to 0 by changing two alt texts, promoting a h2 element to h1 and the subsequent h3 elements to h2.

I also took a moment to add styles to stop the buttons from spanning the entire width of the screen. This applies to the home page, the confirmation page and the 404 page. They now look like this.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned how VS Code and GitHub work together to deploy live websites.
- I deepended and consolidated my understanding of HTML and CSS.
- I gained a basic understanding of JavaScript.
- I learned how to troubleshoot and find bugs more efficiently.
- I learned why it is important to commit often to demonstrate my development process.
- I deepened my understanding of responsive layout with Bootstrap's grid system.
- I learned why it's important to design for accessibility from the beginning, rather than fitting it at the end.
- I learned visual design with semantic HTML taught me how to build with both users and machines (screen readers and search engines) in mind.
- I learned how to use many different resources that work together to polish a website, including wireframes, colour scheme tools, validators and performance checkers.
- I learned how to use GitHub Pages.

## Note on Commit History

During the early stages of this project, I encountered an issue that prevented me from deploying my website on GitHub Pages. This is because my local VS Code instance wasn't properly connected to GitHub. The save button was greyed out despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot.

After reaching out to a Code Institute alumni (credited below) for support, I was advised to start a fresh GitHub repository and transfer my code over, which I did. This resulted in a large initial commit which you will see as the first commit on the current live repository.

However, I did not delete the original repo and it still contains my earliest commits and development history. While most of the commit history exists in the current repo, the initial work can still be viewed via the link below.

Original repo (where you can see my early commit history and original User Stories): https://github.com/LouisCE/warrior-path-x
Current repo (for submission and deployment): https://github.com/LouisCE/warrior-path

I spoke about this issue with my facilitator (also credited below) and it was confirmed with the assessment team that this would not be an issue. From that point onward, I have followed a consistent practice of committing my work to clearly demonstrate my development process.
